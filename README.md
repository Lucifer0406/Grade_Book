# 📊 Grade Book Analysis – Excel Project

Welcome to my Excel-based **Grade Book** project! This project demonstrates my ability to clean, organize, analyze, and visualize data using Microsoft Excel. I created this as part of my journey into learning Excel, and it serves as a hands-on representation of the concepts I’ve learned so far.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The Grade Book is a data-driven report that tracks students' performances across multiple tests, including:

- Safety Test
- Company Philosophy Test
- Financial Skills Test
- Drug Test

The data includes student names, raw scores, and calculated percentages. It also includes overall statistics like **Maximum**, **Minimum**, and **Average** scores across all tests.

## ✅ Concepts Used

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Formatting**
- Organized raw data into a structured tabular format.
- Used consistent formatting for readability.

### 2. **Formulas and Functions**
- Applied formulas to calculate **percentages** for each test:
  - Example: `=Score / MaxScore`
- Used **logical functions** like `IF` to determine if an employee passed or failed.

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**
- Calculated:
  - **Maximum** score using `=MAX()`
  - **Minimum** score using `=MIN()`
  - **Average** score using `=AVERAGE()`

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Created charts to visualize:
  - Distribution of scores in the Safety Test
  - Company Philosophy Test Scores
  - Financial Skills Test Results
- Used **bar charts** for easy comparison.

### 5. **Conditional Logic**
- Used formulas to flag employees who failed any test.
- Detected anomalies like scores above 100%.

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Displayed trends in student performance.
- Identified top-performing and underperforming individuals.
- Learned how to present complex information clearly using charts and tables.

## 💼 Why This Matters

This project is designed to show my growing comfort with Microsoft Excel – a fundamental tool in data analysis, HR analytics, and business reporting. It also serves as an early step toward more advanced data projects in Excel, Python, and beyond.

## 📂 File Structure

- `Grade_Book.xlsx` – Main workbook with data, formulas, and visualizations.
- `Grade_Book.pdf` – PDF version of the Excel sheet for easy viewing.
- `README.md` – This documentation file.

## 🚀 What's Next

I plan to expand this project with:
- Automated dashboards using Pivot Tables.
- Interactive filters with slicers.
- Integration into Power BI in the future.
